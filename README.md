# 2077_Craft_In_Combat
<pre>
 
 - Craft In Combat allows the player to craft while they are in combat. This mod is useful for builds that
    rely on heavy ammo use such as problem solver and soverign. Cyberpunk has many playstyles that are 
    encouraged by the game systems but punished in use.
    
 - Ricochet builds for example are expected to use alot of ammo as not all bullets are guaranteed to hit
    their targets. This makes power builds less effective than tech or smart weapon builds
    
 - This mod helps alleviate this disparity between power builds and others by allowing the player to be 
    able to craft ammo mid fight.
